Ordnance Survey Places lets users identify addresses accurately. Searches interrogate the Local Authority and the Royal Mail address datasets.

Requests can be made using a full or partial address, a postcode, or a unique property ID. Searches can also find addresses closest to a given point or all the addresses known within a user-defined area or circle.
